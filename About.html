<div class="intro"><div class="text">Who's the guy behind all these photos? I already introduced myself, but who am I? How did I get into Transformers? What has it been like collecting toys? I've got answers to these questions and more down below. And, if the photos I've taken or the things I talk about here have gotten you interested in learning more about Transformers, I've got media recommendations and links to resources to help you do just that.

<div class="hist_text" id="into_TF">
<p>My story with Transformers actually begins with my dad. As a kid growing up in the 80s, my dad ended up with a lot of Transformers toys. Many of these were lost when the basement they were stored in flooded, but a few survived to his adulthood. When I was around 5 years old, he gave some of them to me to play with, and I got a few other Transformers toys from around or before that time; from the movie toyline, or Transformers Cybertron, or Transformers Animated. I watched a few Transformers cartoons during this time, going through repeats of episodes on DVD. As I got older, though, I lost interest in Transformers. Other franchises took my attention as I got more into video games, and the Michael Bay movies blotted out anything else I knew about Transformers (even though I have still not seen them to this day).</p>
<p>Fast forward to late 2018, and trailers for Bumblebee are being released. One of them shows a snippet of the scene on Cybertron, with character designs reminiscent of Generation 1. I was still not into Transformers at this time, but I did recognize those designs and think "Oh, that's cool. They're going back to the old designs....Hey, didn't I use to like this stuff?" Plus, I was a fan of giant robots; Pacific Rim was and still is my favorite movie. I told my dad I was interested, and he ended up taking my brothers and I on a surprise theater visit to go watch it when it was released.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the movie, and it got me interested in getting more into the franchse. Toy collecting was the avenue that stuck out to me the most, because I didn't know how I could read the comics or where I could stream the TV shows. I distinctly remember being at a family gathering for Christmas that year and, when nothing was really happening, ordering my first Transformers toy in a decade on <a href="https://www.bigbadtoystore.com/">BigBadToyStore</a>.</p>
<p>Around this time, I also began watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisMcFeely">Chris McFeely's</a> YouTube series, Transformers: The Basics, to learn more about the franchse. I pulled out those old DVDs we had from when I was a kid to get a taste of some of the cartoons, and watched the original 1986 movie. Since then, I've watched a lot of the cartoons, read through a lot of the comics published by IDW, and spent hours reading on <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Main_Page">TFwiki</a>. There are still some major gaps that I haven't filled; I've only seen a few episodes of the original cartoon, none of the Bay films, only 1/3 of the Unicron Trilogy, and I've barely touched Transformers Prime or the Marvel comic. But I've found the parts of the franchise that I most enjoy, and I tend to stick with them.</p>

<button id="journ_coll_button" class="hist_button">The Journey of Collecting<span>&#8628;</span></button><hr>
<div class="hist_text" id="journ_coll">
<p>When my collection began in 2019, I had no real idea of what I wanted to collect, so it was a mishmash of various lines and characters. The War for Cybertron Trilogy of toylines began this year, so for most of its life my collection weighed heavily in its direction. I started off displaying all of my figures in one shelf of my bookshelf, but once I decided to commit more to the hobby I purchased a second bookshelf just for that purpose.</p>
<p>The 2nd chapter of the War for Cybertron Trilogy was released the following year, and despite terrible distribution and the significant amount of exclusives, I purchased quite a few Earthrise figures, many of whom I didn't actually care much about. I still didn't quite know what specifically I wanted to collect, and 2020 was when this became a problem. Additionally, during this year I picked up a bunch of older figures, both of these events ended up bloating my collection quite a bit.</p>
<p>When I returned home from my first semester of college at the end of 2020, I began to sort my shelves differently, opening the door for me to narrow my collecting focus much later down the line. Previously, I had sorted by faction or size or some other characteristic without much consistency across the whole collection. Here, I started sorting by series, only making exceptions for toys that I designated as one of my favorites. The Kingdom chapter of the War for Cybertron Trilogy had already been announced, and at first, I wasn't very interested in its Beast Wars focus. But I was interested enough to give Beast Wars a watch for the first time during the break...</p>
<p>...and I immediately got onboard the hype train. I was planning on getting 1 or 2 Beast Wars figures from Kingdom because I thought they looked cool, but after I fell in love with the show over the course of my Christmas Break binge, I intended to get all of them. It was my first time collecting toys of characters I really cared about, and it played a large factor in shaping my collecting habits moving forward.</p>
<p>Inspired by a tweet I read from another Transformers collector about making displays instead filling in crowds of people, I decided in the summer to begin downsizing my collection. I bought a new, smaller bookshelf, and abandoned the last remnant of my original sorting system by ditching the "favorites" shelf, hoping to make each specific collection self-containted. I sold a significant portion of my collection during this time, finally dealing with the bloat, and I used the money to (mostly) complete my Beast Wars cast. Later in the year, I did the same for my Transformers Animated collection; guided, like with Beast Wars, by a desire to have toys of characters that I liked.</p>
<p>By the summer of 2022, my collection was approaching what I considered at the time to be 'complete' status: Seven line/series-focused shelves and a few smaller displays set up around my room. Collecting slowed down for a bit, so I spent some time trimming off the last bits of fat until I felt ready to start a completely new shelf. After watching through the entire show, I decided to focus on the Robots in Disguise toyline from 2001.</p>
<p>However, I soon realized I was wrong about my shelves being complete. As summer came to an end, I decided I needed to sell some toys; the end result of that was the reduction of my shelves from seven to five, as I expunged the Transformers Animated and Beast Wars toys that caused me to double up on shelves. A few months later, in my new apartment at college, I did it again, selling my entire Cybertron shelf while also buying the last few Robots in Disguise toys I wanted and finished up my Animated collection. When I was reorganizing during all of this, I had the idea of framing my shelf as a tour of the Transformers multiverse given by Vector Prime, featuring dialogue written and designed to look like comic book captions. That ended up being a very fun project that I would touch up a few times.</p>
<p>That leads us to today. There have been no major changes since fall 2022, but things have changed. I added lights to my shelves, tweaked the captions, and completed and reorganized all my displays. The handful of toys I still have that don't fit my main display I put in my room back home. At an even 50 toys, I have little desire for more, as I lack the space for an additional bookshelf and have gotten more busy with school. Building this website has been where my focus shifted since the beginning of 2023, and so photopgraphy has taken precedence over collecting. It's been a fun and eventul journey to this point: I'm sure I'll get back into it at some point, but I'm happy with what I've got right now.</p>
