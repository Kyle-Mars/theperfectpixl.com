<div class="intro"><div class="text">Who's the guy behind all these photos? I already introduced myself, but who am I? How did I get into Transformers? What has it been like collecting toys? I've got answers to these questions and more down below. And, if the photos I've taken or the things I talk about here have gotten you interested in learning more about Transformers, I've got media recommendations and links to resources to help you do just that.

<p>My story with Transformers actually begins with my dad. As a kid growing up in the 80s, my dad ended up with a lot of Transformers toys. Many of these were lost when the basement they were stored in flooded, but a few survived to his adulthood. When I was around 5 years old, he gave some of them to me to play with, and I got a few other Transformers toys from around or before that time; from the movie toyline, or Transformers Cybertron, or Transformers Animated. I watched a few Transformers cartoons during this time, going through repeats of episodes on DVD. As I got older, though, I lost interest in Transformers. Other franchises took my attention as I got more into video games, and the Michael Bay movies blotted out anything else I knew about Transformers (even though I have still not seen them to this day).</p>
<p>Fast forward to late 2018, and trailers for Bumblebee are being released. One of them shows a snippet of the scene on Cybertron, with character designs reminiscent of Generation 1. I was still very much not in Transformers at this time, but I did recognize those designs and think "Oh, that's cool. They're going back to the old designs....Hey, didn't I use to like this stuff?" Plus, I was a fan of giant robots; Pacific Rim was and still is my favorite movie. I told my dad I was interested, and he ended up taking my brothers and I on a surprise theater visit to go watch it when it was released.</p>
<p>I really enojyed the movie, and it got me interested in getting more into the franchse. Toy collecting was the avenue that stuck out to me the most, because I didn't know how I could read the comics or where I could stream the TV shows. I distinctly remember being at a family gathering for Christmas that year and, when nothing was really happening, ordering my first Transformers toy in a decade on BigBadToyStore.com.</p>
<p>Around this time, I also began watching Chris McFeely's YouTube series, Transformers: The Basics, to learn more about the franchse. I pulled out those old DVDs we had from when I was a kid to get a taste of some of the cartoons, and watched the original 1986 movie. Since then, I've watched a lot of the cartoons, read through a lot of the comics published by IDW, and spent hours reading on TFwiki.net. There are still some major gaps that I haven't filled; I've only seen a few episodes of the original cartoon, none of the Bay films, only 1/3 of the Unicron Trilogy, and I've barely touched Transformers Prime or the Marvel comic. But I've found the parts of the franchise that I most enjoy, and I tend to stick with them.</p>
