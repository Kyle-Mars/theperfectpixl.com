<button id="into_TF_button" class="hist_button">Getting into Transformers<span>&#8628;</span></button><hr>
<div class="hist_text" id="into_TF">
<p>My story with Transformers actually begins with my dad. As a kid growing up in the 80s, my dad ended up with a lot of Transformers toys. Many of these were lost when the basement they were stored in flooded, but a few survived to his adulthood. When I was around 5 years old, he gave some of them to me to play with, and I got a few other Transformers toys from around or before that time; from the movie toyline, or Transformers: Cybertron, or Transformers Animated. I also watched a few Transformers cartoons during this time, going through repeats of episodes on DVD. As I got older, though, I lost interest in Transformers. Other franchises took my attention as I got more into video games, and the Michael Bay movies blotted out anything else I knew about Transformers (even though I have still not seen them to this day).</p><br>
<p>Fast forward to late 2018, and trailers for Bumblebee are being released. One of them shows a snippet of the scene on Cybertron, with character designs reminiscent of Generation 1. I was still not into Transformers at this time, but I did recognize those designs and think "Oh, that's cool. They're going back to the old designs....Hey, didn't I use to like this stuff?" Plus, I was a fan of giant robots; Pacific Rim was and still is my favorite movie. I told my dad I was interested, and he ended up taking my brothers and I on a surprise theater visit to go watch it when it was released.</p><br>
<p>I really enjoyed the movie, and it got me interested in getting more into the franchse. Toy collecting was the avenue that stuck out to me the most, because I didn't know how I could read the comics or where I could stream the TV shows. I distinctly remember being at a family gathering for Christmas that year and, when nothing was really happening, ordering my first Transformers toy in a decade on <a href="https://www.bigbadtoystore.com/">BigBadToyStore</a>.</p><br>
<p>Around this time, I also began watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisMcFeely">Chris McFeely's</a> YouTube series, Transformers: The Basics, to learn more about the franchse. I pulled out those old DVDs we had from when I was a kid to get a taste of some of the cartoons, and watched the original 1986 movie. Since then, I've watched a lot of the cartoons, read through a lot of the comics published by IDW, and spent a lot of time reading on <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Main_Page">TFwiki</a>. There are still some major gaps that I haven't filled; I've only seen a few episodes of the original cartoon, none of the Bay films, only 1/3 of the Unicron Trilogy, and I've barely touched Transformers Prime or the Marvel comic. But I've found the parts of the franchise that I most enjoy, and I tend to stick with them.</p>

<button id="journ_coll_button" class="hist_button">The Journey of Collecting<span>&#8628;</span></button><hr>
<div class="hist_text" id="journ_coll">
<p>When my collection began in 2019, I had no real idea of what I wanted to collect, so it was a mishmash of various lines and characters. The War for Cybertron trilogy of toylines began this year, so for most of its life my collection weighed heavily in that direction. I started off displaying all of my figures in one shelf of my bookshelf, but once I decided to commit more to the hobby I purchased a second bookshelf just for that purpose.</p><br>
<p>The 2nd chapter of the War for Cybertron Trilogy was released the following year. Despite terrible distribution and the significant amount of exclusives, I purchased quite a few figures from this line, many of whom I didn't actually care much about. I still didn't quite know what specifically I wanted to collect, and 2020 was when this became a problem. Additionally, during this year I picked up a bunch of older figures, both of these events ended up bloating my collection quite a bit.</p><br>
<p>When I returned home from my first semester of college at the end of 2020, I began to sort my shelves differently, opening the door for me to narrow my collecting focus much later down the line. Previously, I had sorted by faction or size or some other characteristic without much consistency across the whole collection. Here, I started sorting only by series, making exceptions just for toys that I designated as a favorite.</p><br>
<p>The 3rd chapter of the War for Cybertron Trilogy, Kingdom, had already been announced by this time. At first I wasn't very interested in Kingdom, with its focus on Beast Wars, the main Transformers series during the 1990s. I was interested enough to watch Beast Wars for the first time during the break, however... and after that I was completely sold. I loved the show, and seeing mostly screen accurate toys of the characters got me excited for the line. Kingdom was the first time I was collecting toys of characters I really cared about, and that experience played a large factor in shaping my collecting habits moving forward.</p><br>
<p>Inspired by a tweet I read from another Transformers collector about making displays instead filling in crowds of people, I decided in the summer to begin downsizing my collection. I bought a new, smaller bookshelf, and abandoned the last remnant of my original sorting system by ditching the "favorites" shelf. I sold a significant portion of my collection during this time, finally dealing with the bloat, and I used the money to (mostly) complete my Beast Wars cast. Later in the year, I did the same for my Transformers Animated collection; guided, like with Beast Wars, by a desire to have toys of characters that I liked.</p><br>
<p>By the summer of 2022, my collection was approaching what I considered at the time to be 'complete' status: seven line/series-focused shelves and a few smaller displays set up around my room. Collecting slowed down for a bit, so I spent some time trimming off the last bits of fat until I felt ready to start a completely new shelf. After watching through the entire show, I decided to focus on the Robots in Disguise toyline from 2001.</p><br>
<p>However, I soon realized I was wrong about my shelves being complete. As summer came to an end, I decided I needed to sell more toys; so I expunged the Transformers Animated and Beast Wars toys that caused me to double up on those shelves. A few months later, in my new apartment at college, I did it again, selling my entire Cybertron shelf while also buying the last few Robots in Disguise toys I wanted and finished up my Animated collection. When I was reorganizing during all of this, I had the idea of framing my shelf as a tour of the Transformers multiverse given by the in-universe character Vector Prime, featuring dialogue written and designed to look like comic book captions. That ended up being a very fun project that I would touch up a few times.</p><br>
<p>That leads us to today. There have been no major changes since fall 2022, but things have changed. I added lights to my shelves, tweaked the captions, and completed and reorganized all my displays. The handful of toys I still have that don't fit my main display I put in my room back home. At an even 50 toys, I have little desire for more, as I lack the space for an additional bookshelf and have gotten more busy with school. Building this website has been where my focus shifted since the beginning of 2023, and so photopgraphy has taken precedence over collecting. It's been a fun and eventul journey to this point: I'm sure I'll get back into it at some point, but I'm happy with what I've got right now.</p>

<button id="photo_button" class="hist_button">Photographs and Websites<span>&#8628;</span></button><hr>
<div class="hist_text" id="photo">
<p>I started taking photos very early on into collecting, of my toys and my shelves. For a long while, both were simply for record keeping purposes. As a result, I didn't put in a ton of effort. I would play with my toys for a bit, find a pose or situation I liked, and take a picture of it, not worrying about proper lighting, interesting backgrounds or great composition. Not helping this was the fact that I rarely took photos outside, so natural lighting (both in terms of color and direction) wasn't an option I considered. That isn't to say I had no good photos from this time, but that I just wasn't very concerned with quality. This was the norm until August 2021, when I began to take photos outside more consistently.</p><br>
<p>Shortly after this, I began a mission to take photos of every toy in my collection, or at least every toy I had with me at college. These photos were all taken outside, so the lighting and background made them look much more appealing, but the composition still wasn't great. Since I was still thinking of these as records, I tended to put the toys dead center in the frame with little changes to the camera angle or position across photos. Nevertheless, I liked these photos enough that I started posting them on Instagram. I quickly realized, however, that I was taking more of them than I could realistically post.</p><br>
<p>This led me to build the first version of my website in January 2022. Built and hosted on Weebly, this site served as a place to dump all of my photos. It's layout was similar to the site you are on right now, but I didn't care to do much quality control on my photos; I just wanted to throw them all out there. The website was hosted for free, layout changes were relatively easy, and building and maintaining the site did not require much of me. So I kept taking pictures to post; but as I did so, Weebly began to show its flaws. All the photos I had on the page showed down the editor significantly, making updating the site a pain.</p><br>
<p>It was this frustration with Weebly, and a desire to have my own specific url, that led me to decide that I would remake this site from scratch using more traditional web development techniques. I got started in early January 2023, it took me only a few days to replicate what I had made on Weebly. After that, though, I spend 2 weeks improving the overall visual design of the website, doing quality control on my photos, and implementing best practices and optimization strategies for desktop and mobile web development.</p><br>
<p>All of this also reignited my interest in photography, which had fallen on the wayside due to my frustrations with Weebly. I've started trying to improve my photography with more interesting compositions and shot angles, and even went back and cropped a ton of my old photos to make them look nicer. Right now, I'm working on taking photos of toys that don't have any, and replacing old photos with newer, better ones where I can. Photography has made this hobby much more engaging, and it's nice to create something with the toys I have instead of constantly buying new ones.</p><br>

<button id="favs_button" class="hist_button">Favorite Toys, Media, etc.<span>&#8628;</span></button><hr>
<div class="hist_text" id="favs">
<p>With the huge variety of shows, toylines, comics, and characters in Transformers, you're bound to like some more than others. I've got my own personal preferences, and other people have theirs. You might be able tell what some of them are by looking at what I've got on this website, but I'd like to share them anyway.</p><br>
<p>My favorite toys span the breadth of Transformers, across time and space. Some of these are toys I considered holy grails, some of them were suprise hits, and some were love at first sight:</p>
<ul><br>
	<li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Vector_Prime#Cybertron">GC-03 Vector Prime</a> was released in 2004 by Hasbro's Japanese parter, Takara. His articulation is average, but his stunning paint job and fun accessories more than makes up for it. He holds a special place in my heart because the American release of this toy was one of my earliest Transformers. You can see photos of him in the Main Gallery.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Megatron_(Animated)#Leader_Class">Leader Class Megatron</a> was released in 2008 as a part of the Transformers Animated toyline. One of the largest Animated toys, Megatron has decent articulation, is a delight to look at, and can play voice clips from the show. And just like in the show, he transforms into a twin-rotor helicopter, with swords as the helicopter blades. Awesome.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Primus#Cybertron">Supreme Class Cybertron Primus</a> was released in 2006 as the jewel of the Transformers: Cybertron line. As a toy of Primus, the creator of the Transformers, he transforms via special mechanims into the planet Cybertron itself. He was one of my holy grails starting out, and obtaining him was very satisfying. His photos are also in the Main Gallery.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(G1)/Generations_toys#War_for_Cybertron_Trilogy">Battle 3-Pack Optimus Prime</a> was released in 2020 as a part of the Netflix subline of the War for Cybertron Trilogy. A rerelease of <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(G1)/Generations_toys#War_for_Cybertron:_Earthrise">Leader Class Optimus Prime</a> in a new color scheme, this is one of if not the best Optimus Prime toys released in a mainline, with great articulation, a fun and inventige transformation, and excellent quality overall.</li><br>
</ul>
<p> Of course, there is more to this franchise than just toys. I've spent a lot of time with various pieces of Transformers media, and there are a bunch that I enjoy more than others:</p>
<ul><br>
	<li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_Animated_(cartoon)">Transformers Animated</a>, released in 2007, is one of the most unique cartoons in the franchise, both visually and in terms of story. Drawing inspiration from all across the brand's history and flipping established ideas on their head, Transformers Animated takes after superhero shows, featuring both human supervillains and Decepticons alike.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Beast_Wars:_Transformers_(cartoon)">Beast Wars: Transformers</a> was among the earliest CG animated shows when it aired in 1996. Though initially reviled by some fans for its departure from realistic vehicle modes to realistic animal modes, Beast Wars soon cemented itself as one of the best Transformers cartoons before or since, with a great plot, characters, and humor.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/The_Transformers:_More_than_Meets_the_Eye">The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye</a>&#47;<a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/The_Transformers:_Lost_Light">The Transformers: Lost Light</a> are 2 parts of the same comic book series published by IDW in 2012. These books are considered some of the best Transformers media, with stellar characters and fun stories, including one of Transformer's most notable character arcs: Autobot Megatron.</li><br>
	<li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers:_Robots_in_Disguise_(2001_cartoon)">Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a> was originally developed by Takara in 2000 as a tie-in to the toyline they had been working on. Hasbro imported the lighthearted adventure comedy to the US in 2001, where it was dubbed into English. Unfortunately, immediately after going on the air, it had to undergo several revisions as a result of the 9/11 attacks.</li><br>
