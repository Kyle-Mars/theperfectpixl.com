Leaning hard into the modern trend of updated versions of classic characters, each chapter featured its own unique aesthetic; Siege had Cybertronian alternate modes and battle damage paint, Earthrise delivered clean Earth mode updates, and Kingdom pulled in characters from Beast Wars for the series’ 25th anniversary.</p><p><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers:_Legacy_(toyline)">Legacy</a> and <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers:_Legacy_(toyline)#Legacy:_Evolution">Legacy Evolution</a> were the successors to the War for Cybertron Trilogy, using the same design principles and aesthetic while bringing in a more diverse cast of characters from across the franchise.</p>',

      '<p><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_Animated_(toyline)">Transformers Animated</a> from 2007 is one of the most loved Transformers series, despite very mixed reception when it was first revealed. Characterized by its unique, hyper-stylized character designs by the mind behind the art direction of Teen Titans and&nbsp;Ben 10: Omniverse, Animated&nbsp;is my favorite Transformers cartoon, and the accompanying toyline was incredible in how well it adapted such stylized design to plastic.</p>',

      '<p><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers:_Robots_in_Disguise_(2001_toyline)">Robots in Disguise</a> was originally conceived in Japan in 2000 as Car Robots, returning to realistic vehicle alternate modes after Beast Wars and its Japanese sequels focused heavily on realistic animals. The Car Robots line was made up of several new toys alongside recolored toys from every previous Transformers toyline, all thrown together in a fascinating mishmash of styles. Hasbro imported Car Robots in 2001 as Robots in Disguise: the first total reboot of the Transformers brand.</p>',

      '<p>My story with Transformers began with my dad. As a kid growing up in the 80s, he ended up with a lot of Transformers toys. Many of these were lost when the basement they were stored in flooded, but a few survived to his adulthood. When I was around 5 years old, he gave some of them to me to play with, and I got a few other Transformers toys from around or before that time; from the movie toyline, Transformers: Cybertron, and Transformers Animated. As I got older and pivoted to video games, I lost interest in Transformers. Other franchises took my attention, and the notoriety of the Michael Bay movies blotted out anything else I knew about Transformers.</p><p>Fast forward to late 2018, when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAIX12F6958">this trailer</a> for Bumblebee released, showing off character designs reminiscent of Generation 1. I was still not into Transformers at this time, but I did recognize those designs and think "Oh, that\'s cool. They\'re going back to the old designs....Hey, didn\'t I used to like this stuff?" I told my dad I was interested, and he ended up taking my brothers and I on a surprise theater visit to go watch it when it was released.</p><p>I loved the movie, and it got me interested in getting more into the franchise. Toy collecting was the avenue that stuck out to me the most because I didn\'t know how I could read the comics or where I could stream the TV shows. Because of this, I began watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisMcFeely">Chris McFeely\'s</a> YouTube series, Transformers: The Basics, to learn more about the franchise. Since then, I’ve continued to dive deeper into Transformers, spending hours reading <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Main_Page">TFWiki</a>, watching the cartoons, reading the comics, and listening to podcasts. I\'ve discovered what parts of the franchise that I most enjoy, and I tend to stick with them.</p>',

      '<p>When my collection began in 2019, I had no real idea of what I wanted to collect. The <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/War_for_Cybertron_Trilogy">War for Cybertron Trilogy</a> began this year with <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/War_for_Cybertron:_Siege">Siege</a> following <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Power_of_the_Primes_(toyline)">Power of the Primes</a>, so my early collection weighed heavily in those directions, while still being very much a mishmash of whatever I thought interesting. At first, all of my figures fit on a single bookshelf shelf, but once I decided to commit more to the hobby I purchased a second bookshelf to have more space. </p><p><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/War_for_Cybertron:_Earthrise">Earthrise</a> was the 2nd chapter of the War for Cybertron Trilogy. Despite terrible distribution and the significant amount of exclusives, I purchased quite a few figures from this line, many of whom I didn\'t actually care much about. Additionally, I picked up many figures from older toylines this year, all of which ended up bloating my collection quite a bit. I still didn\'t know what specifically I wanted to collect, and 2020 was the year this became a problem.</p><p><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/War_for_Cybertron:_Kingdom">Kingdom</a> closed out the War for Cybertron Trilogy in 2021. Upon being revealed, I wasn\'t very interested in the Beast Wars-focused line; but I was interested enough to give Beast Wars a try during that Winter Break... and after that I was completely sold. I loved the show, and Kingdom was the first time I collected toys of characters I cared about. That experience played a large factor in shaping my collecting habits for the next year and a half.</p><p>I decided that summer to finally begin downsizing my collection. I bought a new, smaller bookshelf, sold a significant portion of my collection during this time, and used the money to fill out my Kingdom Beast Wars cast. Later in the year, I did the same for my Transformers Animated cast; guided, like with Beast Wars, by a desire to have toys of characters that I liked. These decisions led to a change in my attitude towards collecting; after this point, I was much quicker to sell toys I didn’t like or felt little attachment to.</p><p>By the summer of 2022, my collection was approaching what I considered at the time to be \'complete\' status. Collecting slowed down as I spent some time trimming off the last bits of fat until I felt ready to start a completely new shelf. After hearing great things about it on the <a href="https://www.tripletakeover.com/">Triple Takeover Toycast</a>, and watching through the entire show, I decided to focus on the <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers:_Robots_in_Disguise_(2001_toyline)">Robots in Disguise</a> toyline from 2001.</p><p>I soon realized I was wrong about my shelves being complete. As summer came to an end, I decided I needed to sell more toys; I expunged the Transformers Animated and Kingdom Beast Wars toys that caused me to double up on those shelves, and sold almost my entire <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers:_Cybertron_(toyline)">Transformers Cybertron</a> shelf.</p><p>In 2023, I mixed up things even further. Due to the Triple Takeover Toycast and my changing tastes, my priorities shifted entirely away from modern toys and character-focused collecting. I sold almost my entire War for Cybertron Trilogy collection to create a shelf for vintage <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/The_Transformers_(toyline)">Generation 1</a> toys, reorganized to create space for toys from the <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers:_Energon_(toyline)#Takara_Super_Link_toyline">Super Link</a> toyline, and picked up a few holy grails. Finally truly satisfied with my collection, I decided in January 2024 to take a 5-month hiatus from collecting, to focus on graduating college and enjoying the toys I already have.</p>',

      "<p>I started taking photos early on into collecting simply for record keeping purposes. As a result, I didn't put in a ton of effort: I would play with my toys for a bit and find a pose or situation I liked, not worrying about proper lighting, backgrounds, or composition. That isn't to say I had no good photos from this time, but that I just wasn't very concerned with quality.</p><p>In August 2021, I began a mission to take photos of every toy in my collection. These photos were all taken outside, so the lighting and background made them look much more appealing, but the composition still wasn't great. Nevertheless, I liked these photos enough that I started posting them on Instagram. I quickly realized, however, that I was taking more of them than I could realistically post.</p><p>This led me to build the first version of my website in January 2022. I chose to use a website builder to create and host it, so layout changes were relatively easy, and building and maintaining the site did not require much of me. However, as I continued to add photos, the editor slowed significantly, making updating the site a pain.</p><p>It was this frustration and a desire to have my own specific URL that led me to remake this site from scratch. I spent about 3 weeks in January 2023 learning more about web development, remaking the pages in code, and improving the GUI. A year later, I took the time to port the website over to a Javascript framework I learned through an internship.</p><p>This decision was prompted by a renewed interest in photography. I took a significant break from photos during the latter part of 2023, but getting proper indoor equipment finally gave me the opportunity to get back into it. Photography has made this hobby much more engaging, especially after I decided to take several months off of buying new toys. It’s fun to create something with the toys I have instead of focusing on buying new ones.</p>",

I\'d like to share them anyway.</p><ul><li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Vector_Prime#Cybertron">GC-03 Vector Prime</a> was released in 2004 by Hasbro\'s Japanese partner, Takara, as a part of their Galaxy Force toyline. His stunning paint job and fun accessories make him stand out among the line, and all of Transformers. He holds a special place in my heart because the American release of this toy was one of my earliest Transformers.</li><li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Optimus_Prime_(Armada)/toys#Cybertron">GC-01 Galaxy Convoy</a> was also released in 2004 as a part of Galaxy Force. One of the coolest versions of Optimus Prime, Galaxy Convoy embodies the best of what early 2000s Transformers has to offer: Fun and unintrusive gimmicks, satisfying ratchet joints, and sheer heft. Pure Awesomeness.</li><li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Primus#Cybertron">Supreme Class Primus</a> was released in 2006 as the jewel of the Transformers: Cybertron line. As a toy of Primus, the creator of the Transformers, he transforms via special mechanisms into a quite detailed planet Cybertron, and is still the only mold ever made of the planet. He was one of my holy grails starting out, and finding him for a good price was extremely exciting.</li><li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Ruination_(RID)#Robots_in_Disguise_.282001.29">D-011 Baldigus</a> was released in 2000 as a part of the Japanese Car Robots toyline. A gorgeous redeco of the Generation 1 toy Bruticus, Baldigus is a combiner made of a team of military vehicle Decepticons. With the fun simplicity of the original molds and ability to mix and match the limbs, Baldigus is one toy I did not expect to own so soon into my collection.</li></ul><p> Of course, there is more to this franchise than just toys. I\'ve spent a lot of time with various pieces of Transformers media, and there are a bunch that I enjoy more than others:</p><ul><li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers_Animated_(cartoon)">Transformers Animated</a>, released in 2007, is one of the most unique cartoons in the franchise, both visually and in terms of story. Drawing inspiration from all across the brand\'s history and flipping established ideas on their head, Transformers Animated takes after superhero shows, featuring both human supervillains and Decepticons alike.</li><li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Beast_Wars:_Transformers_(cartoon)">Beast Wars: Transformers</a> was among the earliest CGI cartoons when it aired in 1996. Though initially reviled by some fans for its departure from realistic alt/vehicle modes to realistic animal modes, Beast Wars soon cemented itself as one of the best Transformers cartoons before or since, with a great plot, characters, and humor.</li><li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/The_Transformers:_More_than_Meets_the_Eye">The Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye</a>&#47;<a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/The_Transformers:_Lost_Light">The Transformers: Lost Light</a> are 2 parts of the same comic book series published by IDW in 2012. These books are considered some of the best Transformers media, with stellar characters and fun stories, including one of Transformers\' most notable character arcs: Autobot Megatron.</li><li><a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Transformers:_Robots_in_Disguise_(2001_cartoon)">Transformers: Robots in Disguise</a> was originally developed by Takara in 2000 as a tie-in to the Car Robots toyline. Hasbro dubbed the lighthearted adventure comedy into English in 2001.  Incredibly underrated within the Transformers community, Robots in Disguise is charming and goofy, best exemplified by its breakout character, Sky-Byte.</li></ul>',
